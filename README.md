# Mechanical-Engineering-Matlab
Here are all of the Matlab functions and scripts that I created to assist me in my mechanical engineering degree.
Some of these files were made quickly just to get something done, and not all of them are "end user" friendly or ready. 
I will attempt to go though and clean all of these up but as of now they are "Use as your own risk" and I promise nothing.
